The GitHub repository for each Quick Start includes the following folders:

- **docs** - (optional) Contains the Quick Start deployment guide content.
- **templates** - (required) Contains the AWS CloudFormation templates for the Quick Start. All templates use the .template file extension.
- **scripts** - (optional) Contains the scripts and configuration files that are used in the Quick Start; for example, to orchestrate the bootstrap, install or configure an app, or update a host.
- **functions** - (optional) Contains lambda functions used in the Quick Start.
- **submodules** - (optional) Used for any referenced Quick Starts that are configured as submodules of the Quick Start. These follow the naming convention _/submodules/quickstart-repo-name_ where the contents are synced at a specific commit level.

Do not worry if some of the folders described above doesn't make sense, yet. As you follow along the rest of the workshop, things will get more clear.

### Copy repo URL

Copy the url of your github repo
![repo url](/images/copy-qs-workshop-path.png)

### Clone repo

Clone the repo by running the following command. Replace *GITHUB_REPO_URL* with your url.

`git clone GITHUB_REPO_URL`

You should see following output.
<pre>
Admin:~/environment $ git clone https://github.com/sshvans/qs-workshop.git
Cloning into 'qs-workshop'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
</pre>

If you see above error message, it means you are using SSH URL to clone the repository, and you don't have SSH private key setup on your development environment machine.

To quick fix the issue, run `git clone GITHUB_REPO_URL` with HTTPS URL of your GitHub repo.

### Create scaffolding
When a Quick Start repo is created by the Quick Start team, all the folders are pre-created for you. But, as you are creating your own repo for this workshop, you need to create necessary folders.

To make this task easy, we have pre-created the scaffolding and configurations files. Run the following commands to download the scaffolding and files.

1. Go to repo

 	`cd qs-workshop`

2. Download and load the content in your repo

	```
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-workshop-labs/main/workshop-base/base.tar | tar -x
	```

3. Add and Commit your changes

	`git add --all .`

	`git commit -a -m 'Load base content'`
	
	You should see the following output.
	
	<pre>
	[master (root-commit) ab0660b] Load base content
	 	 3 files changed, 33 insertions(+)
		 create mode 100644 .taskcat.yml
		 create mode 100644 templates/workshop.template.yaml
		 create mode 100644 templates/main.template.yaml
	</pre>

4. Now that you have your changes committed locally to your repo, we will push these changes to github remote main branch.

	`git push`
	
	You should see the following output.
	
	<pre>
	Enumerating objects: 7, done.
	Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.
	Delta compression using up to 8 threads
	Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
	Writing objects: 100% (7/7), 753 bytes | 753.00 KiB/s, done.
	Total 7 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
	To github.com:avattathil/qs-workshop.git

	</pre>

#### Prompt: Enter github username
<pre>
Admin:~/environment/qs-workshop (main) $ git push
Username for 'https://github.com':
</pre>

Don't worry if you see the above prompt. It's asking you to enter the github username and password to authenticate your git action. You see this prompt because you are doing *git push* for the first time. Here onwards, Git has cached your credentials in memory for the time period specified in [Setup Git CLI](/10_prerequisites/40_setup_github_cli.html#configure-git-credentials) step. 

Enter your github username and personal token (for password) to push the changes. Your output should look like following:

<pre>
Admin:~/environment/qs-workshop (main) $ git push
Username for 'https://github.com': sshvans
Password for 'https://sshvans@github.com': 
Counting objects: 7, done.
Delta compression using up to 2 threads.

### Create development branch

When you create a GitHub repository, it only contains **main** branch. 

As a best practice, you should keep the development and release branches separate. We will use **develop** branch for development and **main** branch for releases of the Quick Start. 

![git branches](/images/git-branches.png?height=50%&width=50%)

Currently, we only have _main_ branch in our github repo. So, let's create a _develop_ branch from the _main_ branch.

1. Create and checkout develop branch from main

	`git checkout -b develop`

2. Push develop branch to remote and set the upstream

	`git push --set-upstream origin develop`
	
	Your  output should look like below:

	<pre>
	Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '192.30.253.113' to the list of known hosts.
	Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)

	** [new branch]      develop -> develop
