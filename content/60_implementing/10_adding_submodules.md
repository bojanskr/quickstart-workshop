The Quick Start catalog has **160+** Quick Starts. It includes a [VPC Quick Start](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/vpc/) which builds a virtual private network (VPC) environment with public and private subnets, following AWS best practices. 

You will use the VPC Quick Start to create a VPC in your workshop Quick Start. By using an existing Quick Start, you get the following benefits:

- Re-use the architeture built by AWS SAs, which follows the AWS best practices.
- Automatically get the AMI and security updates for VPC and Linux bastion stacks.
- Less code to maintain.
- Focus on building the workload.
- Avoid duplicating same code across multiple Quick Starts

### Git Submodules
To use the VPC Quick Start in your workshop Quick Start, you will use Git Submodules.

Git Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.

We will add a submodule to the **qs-workshop** repo - QuickStart VPC.

### Add a VPC to your project
Change directory to the root of your repo.

Make sure you are in *qs-workshop* folder.

Add QuickStart VPC as a submodule.

```
git submodule add -b master https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-aws-vpc.git submodules/quickstart-aws-vpc
```

By running the above command, you have added the **quickstart-aws-vpc** git repo as a submodule in the **submodules/quickstart-aws-vpc** directory of qs-workshop repo, and the submodule is tracking the master branch of the *quickstart-aws-vpc*.

Now, Commit your changes and push to the develop branch.

`git commit -a -m "Add QuickStart VPC Submodule"`

{{% notice tip %}}
If you need to update your submodules later you can use the following command  `git submodule update --recursive`
Similarly, if you are cloning an existing repo that already contains a submodule you will need to run `git submodule init` first, then `git submodule update -r` after to copy the contents.

### Verify project structure

Your project directory **qs-workshop** should look like below.

<pre>
    ├── submodules
    │   ├── quickstart-aws-vpc
    │       ├── LICENSE.txt
    │       ├── NOTICE.txt
    │       ├── README.md
    │       ├── templates
    │       │   └── aws-vpc.template
    │       └── .taskcat.yml
    │
    ├── templates
    │   └── main.template.yaml
    │   └── workshop.template.yaml
    ├── .gitmodules
    └── .taskcat.yml
</pre>

Once you have verified that your project structure is correct, its time to push the changes to the develop branch.

Run `git push origin develop`
